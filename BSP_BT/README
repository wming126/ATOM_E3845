          README: Intel(R) Atom

This file contains board-specific information for Intel(R) Atom BSP.

This file documents BSP interface changes from previous software or hardware
versions, and notifies the user of serious caveats that must be noted before
using this BSP.

Additionally, the target board's reference entry (e.g., man itl_atom for UNIX
or the HTML reference entries) provides board-specific information necessary
to run VxWorks.  The target reference entry should be read fully before this
BSP is used.
